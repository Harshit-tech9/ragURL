## Approach
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Created dedicated Python environment for URLinsights
   - Configured necessary dependencies and libraries

2. **Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Utilized UnstructuredURLLoader (LangChain Community) for URL content extraction
   - Implemented text chunking (size: 1024, overlap: 100) for optimal embedding creation
   - Integrated sentence-transformers all-mpnet-base-v2 model for embeddings
   - Implemented FAISS for vector storage
   - Integrated Ollama and Groq for answer retrieval

3. **User Interface Development**
   - Built Streamlit-based frontend with features including:
     - User authentication
     - URL management (add/remove/select)
     - Multi-URL information retrieval
     - Chat history management
     
4. **Deployment**
   - Deployed on AWS EC2
   - Extended EBS storage for dependencies
   - Implemented RAG system features (source tracking, context management)
